# Project Brief

In the same way kids like to collect football stickers for albums, as an adult your client has been collecting different pubs that he has had a drink in. One aim he had was to drink in every pub in London, for example.Â 

This project, in its simplest form, is to have an app that adds 'virtual pub stickers' to an app-based album once you have been in a pub. This might record a picture and the GPS location of each pub, for example.

As the hospitality industry is seeing a decline in custom, an app such as this might be a really exciting way to revitalise custom, and encourage customers to try more venues.
